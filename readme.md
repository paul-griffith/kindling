# Kindling

A standalone collection of utilities to help [Ignition](https://inductiveautomation.com/) users. Features various tools
to help work with Ignition's custom data export formats.

## Tools

### Thread Viewer

Parses Ignition thread dump .json files (generated by all Ignition mechanisms since 8.1.10).

### IDB Viewer

Opens Ignition .idb files and displays a list of tables and allows arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.

If the file is detected as an Ignition log or metrics file, opens a custom view automatically. Right-click the tab to
switch between IDB views.

### Log Viewer

Open one (or multiple) wrapper.log files. If the output format is Ignition's default, they will be automatically parsed
and presented in the same log view used for system logs. If multiple files are selected, an attempt will be made to
sequence them and present as a single view.

### Archive Explorer

Opens a zip file (including Ignition files like `.gwbk` or `.modl`). Allows opening other tools against the files within
the zip, including the .idb files in a gateway backup.

## Store and Forward Cache Viewer

Opens the [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/) file that contains the Store and Forward disk cache. Attempts to parse the
Java-serialized data within into its object representation. If unable to deserialize (e.g. due to a missing class),
falls back to a string explanation of the serialized data.

Note: If you encounter any issues with missing classes, please file an issue. 

## Usage

Download the hosted installer from [JDeploy](https://www.jdeploy.com/~ignition-kindling) here. These installers allow
for auto-updating upon launch.
If you prefer an offline installation, or to avoid JDeploy, you can also download native installers from
the [Releases page](https://github.com/paul-griffith/kindling/releases).

## Development

Kindling uses Java Swing as a GUI framework, but is written almost exclusively in Kotlin, an alternate JVM language.
Gradle is used as the build tool, and will automatically download the appropriate Gradle and Java version (via the
Gradle wrapper). Most IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ) should figure out the project structure automatically. You can directly
run the main class in your IDE ([`MainPanel`](app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/paulgriffith/kindling/MainPanel.kt)), or you
can run the application via`./gradlew run` at the command line.

## Extension

Kindling uses
the [`ServiceLoader`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
mechanism to register tools. Simply provide an implementation
of [`io.github.paulgriffith.kindling.core.Tool`](core/src/main/kotlin/io/github/paulgriffith/kindling/core/Tool.kt) (or
any of its extensions), appropriately registered on the classpath, to add tools at runtime.

## Contribution

Contributions of any kind (additional tools, polish to existing tools, test files) are welcome.

## Releases

New tags pushed to GitHub will automatically trigger an action-based deployment of the given version, which will trigger
JDeploy to fetch the new version upon next launch. Offline installers (created using jpackage) are also available for
Windows and Linux.
